# Smile Detection

This code uses Python's dlib to detect facial landmarks and count the number of times you smile (A little creepy, I know)

## Dlib
Dlib is a general purpose cross-platform software library written in the programming language C++. It is an open-source software released under a Boost Software License.

## Libraries Required
Imutils, dlib, numpy, opencv
My honest suggestion would be to install dlib using conda  as follows
### conda install -c conda-forge dlib=19.4
